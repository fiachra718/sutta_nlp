{"text": "Even more controversial is SN 44.10 , which addresses an issue not included in the standard list of ten undeclared questions: Is there a self? Is there no self? Many scholars have been uncomfortable with the fact that the Buddha leaves this question unanswered, believing that his statement that \"all phenomena are not-self\" implicitly states that there is no self. Thus they have tried to explain away the Buddha's silence on the existence or non-existence of the self, usually by pointing to the fourth of his reasons for not answering the question: his bewildered interlocutor, Vacchagotta, would have become even more bewildered. Had the Buddha been asked by someone less bewildered, these commentators say, he would have given the straight answer that there is no self. However, these commentators ignore two points. (1) The Buddha's first two reasons for not answering the questions have nothing to do with Vacchagotta. To say that there is a self, he says, would be siding with the wrong views of the eternalists. To say that there is no self would be siding with the wrong views of the annihilationists. (2) Immediately after Vacchagotta leaves, Ven. Ananda asks the Buddha to explain his silence. Had the Buddha really meant to declare that there is no self, this would have been the perfect time to do so, for bewildered people were now out of the way. But, again, he did not take that position.", "entities": [[222, 228, "PERSON"], [407, 413, "PERSON"], [642, 648, "PERSON"], [830, 836, "PERSON"], [1159, 1165, "PERSON"], [1175, 1181, "PERSON"], [1214, 1220, "PERSON"]], "meta": {"nikaya": "SN", "identifier": "sn44.intro.than.html", "title": "Introduction to the Avyakata Samyutta", "para_seq": null}}
{"text": "One peculiarity of this approach to the Buddha's silence on this issue is that many commentators, noting the Buddha's desire not to bewilder Vacchagotta, assume somehow that their readers and listeners at present would not be bewildered by a doctrine that there is no self, and feel free to jump into the breach, stating baldly what they believe the Buddha was simply too reticent to say.", "entities": [[40, 46, "PERSON"], [109, 115, "PERSON"], [350, 356, "PERSON"]], "meta": {"nikaya": "SN", "identifier": "sn44.intro.than.html", "title": "Introduction to the Avyakata Samyutta", "para_seq": null}}
{"text": "Another attempt to explain the Buddha's silence on this issue focuses on the second reason for his silence, saying that the annihilationists had laid claim to the slogan that there is no self, so — because the Buddha did not want his own doctrine of no self to be confused with theirs — he avoided their slogan. This explanation, however, is not supported by the Canon. The doctrines of the annihilationists are presented in a fair amount of detail in the Canon, and nowhere are they quoted as saying outright that there is no self. Thus there is no basis for saying that it was their slogan. Second, there are many instances where the Buddha, when asked a categorical question concerning an issue where he wanted to give a nuanced answer, showed himself perfectly capable of rephrasing the question in more nuanced terms before giving his reply. Had he held a nuanced doctrine that there is no self, he could have easily rephrased Vacchagotta's question before answering it. The fact that he chose not to do so, either in Vacchagotta's or Ven. Ananda's presence, indicates that he felt that this issue, too, was a thicket of views based on a misunderstanding, accompanied by suffering, and not leading to awakening.", "entities": [[31, 37, "PERSON"], [210, 216, "PERSON"], [636, 642, "PERSON"], [1045, 1051, "PERSON"]], "meta": {"nikaya": "SN", "identifier": "sn44.intro.than.html", "title": "Introduction to the Avyakata Samyutta", "para_seq": null}}

According to Dhp 279 , when one sees this fact with discernment to the point of becoming disenchanted with stress, it forms the path to purity. Here the term \"phenomena\" covers fabricated and unfabricated phenomena. The fabricated phenomena encountered along the path include the aggregates, elements, and sense media. The unfabricated phenomenon, encountered when these fabricated phenomena cease, is the deathless. AN 9.96, however, points out that it is possible, on encountering the deathless, to feel a dhamma-passion and dhamma-delight for it, thus preventing full awakening. At this point the realization that all phenomena are not-self would be needed to overcome this last obstacle to total release. And once there is release, one becomes, like the Tathagata, indescribable: \"deep, boundless, hard to fathom, like the ocean.\" At that point, the path is abandoned, like a raft after it has been used to cross a river, and positions that \"there is a self\" and \"there is no self\" would not apply.", "entities": [[848, 857, "PERSON"]], "meta": {"nikaya": "SN", "identifier": "sn44.intro.than.html", "title": "Introduction to the Avyakata Samyutta", "para_seq": null}}
