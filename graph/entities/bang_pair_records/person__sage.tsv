PERSON	sage	31315	snp.4.09.than.html	1	PERSON	Sage	653	657	[Magandiya offers his daughter to the Buddha, who replies:] On seeing [the daughters of Mara] — Discontent, Craving, & Passion — there wasn't even the desire for sex. So what would I want with this, filled with urine & excrement? I wouldn't want to touch it even with my foot. Magandiya: If you don't want this gem of a woman, coveted by many kings, then for what sort of viewpoint, precept, practice, life, attainment of [further] becoming do you argue? The Buddha: 'I argue for this' doesn't occur to one when considering what's grasped among doctrines. Looking for what is ungrasped with regard to views, and detecting inner peace, I saw. Magandiya: Sage, you speak without grasping at any preconceived judgments. This 'inner peace': what does it mean? How is it, by an enlightened person, proclaimed? The Buddha: He doesn't speak of purity in connection with view, learning, knowledge, precept or practice. Nor is it found by a person through lack of view, of learning, of knowledge, of precept or practice. [1] Letting these go, without grasping, at peace, independent, one wouldn't long for becoming. Magandiya: If he doesn't speak of purity in connection with view, learning, knowledge, precept or practice. and it isn't found by a person through lack of view, of learning, of knowledge, of precept or practice, it seems to me that this teaching's confused, for some assume a purity in terms of — by means of — a view. The Buddha: Asking questions dependent on view, you're confused by what you have grasped. And so you don't glimpse even the slightest notion [of what I am saying]. That's why you think it's confused. Whoever construes 'equal,' 'superior,' or 'inferior,' by that he'd dispute; whereas to one unaffected by these three, 'equal,' 'superior,' do not occur. Of what would the brahman say 'true' or 'false,' disputing with whom: he in whom 'equal,' 'unequal' are not. Having abandoned home, living free from society, the sage in villages creates no intimacies. Rid of sensual passions, free from yearning, he wouldn't engage with people in quarrelsome debate.
PERSON	sage	31454	snp.5.04.irel.html	1	PERSON	Sage	1944	1948	[The Venerable Mettagu:] "I ask the Lord this question, may he tell me the answer to it. I know him to be a master of knowledge and a perfected being. From whence have arisen these many sufferings evident in the world?" [The Lord:] "You have asked me the source of suffering. Mettagu, I will tell it to you as it has been discerned by me. These many sufferings evident in the world have arisen from worldly attachments. Whoever ignorantly creates an attachment, that stupid person comes upon suffering again and again. Therefore a man of understanding should not create attachment, seeing it is the source of suffering." [Mettagu:] "What I did ask you have explained, now I ask another question. Come tell me this: how do the wise cross the flood, birth and old age, sorrow and grief? Explain it thoroughly to me, O sage, for this Dhamma has been understood [1] by you." The Lord: "I will set forth the Dhamma, Mettagu, a teaching to be directly perceived, [2] not something based on hearsay, by experiencing which and living mindfully one may pass beyond the entanglements of the world." Mettagu: "I rejoice in the thought of that highest Dhamma, great sage, by experiencing which and living mindfully one may pass beyond the entanglements of the world." [The Lord:] "Whatever you clearly comprehend, Mettagu, above, below, across and in between, get rid of delight in it. Rid yourself of habitual attitudes [3] and (life affirming) consciousness. [4] Do not continue in existence. Living thus, mindful and vigilant, a bhikkhu who has forsaken selfish attachments may, by understanding, abandon suffering, birth and old age, sorrow and grief, even here in this life." [Mettagu:] "I rejoice in the words of the great sage. Well explained, O Gotama, is the state of non-attachment. [5] The Lord has surely abandoned suffering as this Dhamma has been realized by him. They will certainly abandon suffering who are constantly admonished by you, O Sage. Having understood, I venerate it, Noble One. May the Lord constantly admonish me also." [The Lord:] "Whom you know as a true brahmana, a master of knowledge, owning nothing, not attached to sensual (-realm) existence, he has certainly crossed this flood. Having crossed beyond he is untainted and freed from doubt. One who has discarded this clinging (leading) to renewal of existence is a man who has realized the highest knowledge. Free from craving, undistressed, desireless, he has crossed beyond birth and old age, I say."

PERSON	sage	31848	thig.10.01.hekh.html	1	PERSON	Sage	4	8	The Sage has emphasized and praised Noble friendship for the world. If one stays with a Noble Friend, even a fool will become a wise person. Stay with them of good heart for the wisdom of those who stay with them grows. And while one is staying with them, from every kind of dukkha one is freed. Dukkha one should know well, and how dukkha arises and ceases, and the Eightfold Path, and the Four Noble Truths. "Woman's state is painful," declares the Trainer of tamable men. "A wife with others is painful and once having borne a child, some even cut their throats; others of delicate constitution poison take, then pain again; and then there's the baby obstructing the birth, killing the mother too." ... Miserable woman, your kin all dead and limitless dukkha you've known. So many tears have you shed in these many thousands of births. ... Wholly developed by me is the Eightfold Noble Path going to Deathlessness, Nibbana realized, I looked into the Mirror of the Dhamma. With dart removed am I, the burden laid down, done what was to be done, The elder nun Kisagotami, freed in mind and heart, has chanted this.
PERSON	sage	31849	thig.10.01.than.html	1	PERSON	Sage	49	53	Having admirable friends has been praised by the Sage with reference to the world. Associating with an admirable friend even a fool becomes wise. People of integrity should be associated with. In that way discernment grows. Associating with people of integrity one would be released from all suffering & stress, would know stress, the origination of stress, cessation & the eightfold path: the four noble truths. Stressful, painful, is the woman's state: so says the tamer of tamable people. Being a co-wife is painful. Some, on giving birth once, slit their throats. Others, of delicate constitution, take poison. In the midst of a breech-birth both [mother & child] suffer destruction. Going along, about to give birth, I saw my husband dead. Giving birth in the road, I hadn't reached my own home. Two children deceased, my husband dead in the road — miserable me! My mother, father, & brother were burning on a single pyre. "Your family all gone, miserable, you've suffered pain without measure. Your tears have flowed for many thousands of lives." [1] Then I saw, I the midst of the charnel ground, the muscles of sons being chewed. With family killed, despised by all, my husband dead, I reached the Deathless. I've developed this path, noble, eightfold, going to the Deathless. Having realized Unbinding, I've gazed in the mirror of Dhamma. I've cut out the arrow, put down the burden, done the task. I, KisaGotami Theri, my heart well-released, have said this.
